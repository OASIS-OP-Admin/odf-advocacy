ODF Marketing Open Project at OASIS The objective of the ODF (OpenDocument Format) Marketing open project at OASIS is to create awareness and educate about ODF, and provide marketing materials for a sustained communication campaign about standard based document interoperability as opposed to the current false interoperability based on proprietary – albeit approved as standard – document formats. Purpose and Scope Educate users of personal productivity applications such as office suites, word processors, text/document editors, spreadsheets, presentation software, and the likes, about the advantages represented by the adoption of standard document formats, helping them to migrate from the current widely adopted pseudo-standard formats - which are creating interoperability issues and generating huge costs - to the only true document standard available (or ODF). Business Benefits Users of personal productivity software will benefit from the awareness and education campaign, as they will learn about true document interoperability (which is something they do not know and do not understand, as they have been intentionally led to think that true interoperability is possible only if they keep updating their proprietary application to the current version). Large organizations deploying personal productivity software will discover the huge savings which are made possible by true document standards, with the associated advantage of increased security thanks to the reduced number of vulnerabilities affecting files based on standard file formats (for a comparison, please search the NIST CVE database: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).

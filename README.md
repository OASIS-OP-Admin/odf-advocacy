# Welcome to the home of the ODF Marketing Open Project!

The ODF Marketing Open Project works to create awareness and educate the world about the benefits of using the OpenDocument Format OASIS Standard (also published as ISO/IEC 26300).

ODF is an XML-based file format for personal productivity applications such as office suites, word processors, text/document editors, spreadsheets, and presentation software. Use of ODF guarantees access to your data forever, ensuring that data can be transferred between different computers and operating systems, without having to worry about vendor lock-in or license fees.

The ODF Marketing Open Project develops nonn-commercial, informational materials for a sustained communication campaign about the technical advantages and cost-savings of using standard-based document interoperability over proprietary formats.

ODF Marketing is an [OASIS Open Project](oasis-open-projects.org).
